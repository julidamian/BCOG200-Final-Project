If I am understanding Test File correctly, I would think that in order for the user to test
functionality, they would be required to upload a photo to see if that part of my program works.

For the test, I would probably have the user upload with one specific image first, just to get the 
foundation of the code working. This would be a real image taken by me , most likely.

After that, I could expand to using any image the user wants.

To conduct the test for the coloring, I would just use any image I chose to upload to ensure the 
coloring function worked.

Afterwards, I would check to ensure coloring the image the user uploaded works.
