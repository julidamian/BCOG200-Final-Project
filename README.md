# BCOG200-Final-Project

Welcome to your own coloring book!

In this coloring book, you have 5 preloaded images to color from. Make sure you download the zip and unzip the code and folders that come with it to access the images necessary to color. 

Once you have downloaded the code, ensure that you have all the necessary requirements needed to make the code run correctly. 

You can download your own images by placing the image on your desktop, or dragging the image to the images folder to access it directly.

You can even color on the blank page itself before downloading anything.

Happy coloring!!
