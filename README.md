# BCOG200-Final-Project-

1) For my final project, I plan on making some sort of application that allows users to view local restaurants and minimize the stress of
finding a place to eat. While there are thigns like Google, and probably other apps that do similar things, I am genuinely not aware of
any, and Google can be a bit finnicky when determining a place to eat. Users will be allowed to input things like dietary restrictions,
budget, walking distance/ability to travel, expected wait time/how busy a place might be, as well as exlcuding things such as fast food
chains if useres would like that. Furthermore, it would have the option to randomly select a place based on these preferences if the user
cannot decide or rank them based on which input the user feels is most important to them.

2a) Function 1 will ask users to input thier dietary restricction/preferences.


2b) Function 2 will ask for their location - with this will come if they are walking/taking transportation. Both will ask how far they are willing to travel, mile wise, but mostly minutes wise as that's how I think of distance, usually.

2c) Function 3 will include budget. How much they are willing to spend on a meal. If it is only one person, then it will be how much that
user is willing to spend. If it is 2+ people, it will take into account how much they are willing to spend as a whole group, paying together, or each person's budget. 
*will for sure need more functions
