In this coloring book, you have five preloaded images to color from. Make sure you download the zip and unzip the folders from the GitHub to access the images necessary to color. 

Some files are not necessary for this code to run (such as the src and main.py located in "BCOG200-Final-Project-main" because I accidentally created it before giving it a useful purpose and couldn't figure out how to delete it). The folder necessary to run this code is the "final_project" folder that we will be mostly accessing. 

Navigate to your terminal, and follow the given instructions to access the coloring book after unziping it:

You can download your own images by placing the image on your desktop, or dragging the image to the images folder to access it directly.

You can even color on the blank page itself before downloading anything.

Happy coloring!!
