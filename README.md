# BCOG200-Final-Project

I decided to change my final project because it did sound a lot like Yelp to me, too (and it felt more boring). For this project, I want to use Turtles to create a coloring book. If users don't know what to color, then they will get the option to randomize a page from my coloring book that they can work with. To make it more complex, I want to let the users be able to upload their own photo. The program will be able to make it into a 2D, lines-only picture that looks like a page out of a coloring book. From there, users will be able to color between the lines. 

a. Function 1 will ask users to upload a picture of their choice or randomize a page.

b. Funcion 2 will go about tracing the image and finding the main shapes that will let it become all black lines that the user can color over. 

c. Function 3 will use Turtles to let the user color on the page and make it interactive.
